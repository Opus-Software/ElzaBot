No more cold coffee!

Never miss a coffee batch again!

Developed by 5 coffee "dependants" friends and co-workers during a DOJO session, this app will help you get freshly made coffee.

The responsible for preparing coffee just need to press a button once the coffee is ready-to-drink. Everybody interested in this amazing beverage will be instantly notified at the specified slack channel, being able to enjoy the unique smell and taste of recently brewed coffee.

Check out some benefits that drinking coffee may bring to you (according to Medical News Today):
- Coffee may be protective against type 2 diabetes.
- Coffee may help control movement in people suffering from Parkinson's
- Coffee consumption lowers the risk of liver cancer by about 40%
- Regular consumption of coffee is linked to a reduced risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
